  ## Implementation Note:
  ##
  ##    This function was modified to use the SASL security layer for content
  ##    decryption.  As such, the socket read should read in "self.maxbufsize"
  ##    instead of "n" (the requested number of octets).  However, since this
  ##    is one of two places in the code where the socket is read, the read
  ##    size had to be left at "n".  This is because this function is
  ##    apparently only used to read the first 8 octets from a TCP socket.  If
  ##    we read beyond "n" octets, the remaing octets won't be processed and
  ##    the connection handshake will fail.
